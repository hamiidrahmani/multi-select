# Multi-Select Dropdown Component

This project is a multi-select dropdown component built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The component allows users to add new items by typing into an input field and pressing Enter. The dropdown closes when clicking outside of it.

## Features

- **Add New Items**: Users can add new items to the dropdown list by typing into the input field and pressing Enter.
- **Filter Items**: The input field filters the list of dropdown items as the user types.
- **Auto-Select**: If the typed value is not already in the dropdown items, it will be added to the list and automatically selected. If it is already there, it will simply be selected.
- **Close on Click Outside**: The dropdown closes when clicking outside of it.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
